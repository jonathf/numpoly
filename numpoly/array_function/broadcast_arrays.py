    Broadcast any number of arrays against each other.

    Args:
        args:
            The arrays to broadcast.
        subok:
            If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise the
            returned arrays will be forced to be a base-class array (default).

    Return:
        These arrays are views on the original arrays.  They are typically not
        contiguous.  Furthermore, more than one element of a broadcasted array
        may refer to a single memory location. If you need to write to the
        arrays, make copies first. While you can set the ``writable`` flag
        True, writing to a single output value may end up changing more than
        one location in the output array.

    Example:
        >>> poly1 = numpoly.monomial(3).reshape(1, 3)
        >>> poly1
        polynomial([[1, q0, q0**2]])
        >>> poly2 = numpoly.monomial(2).reshape(2, 1)
        >>> poly2
        polynomial([[1],
                    [q0]])
        >>> res1, res2 = numpoly.broadcast_arrays(poly1, poly2)
        >>> res1
        polynomial([[1, q0, q0**2],
                    [1, q0, q0**2]])
        >>> res2
        polynomial([[1, 1, 1],
                    [q0, q0, q0]])
