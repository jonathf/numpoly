    Move axes of an array to new positions.

    Other axes remain in their original order.

    Args:
        a:
            The array whose axes should be reordered.
        source:
            Original positions of the axes to move. These must be unique.
        destination:
            Destination positions for each of the original axes. These must
            also be unique.

    Return:
        Array with moved axes. This array is a view of the input array.

    Example:
        >>> poly = numpoly.monomial(6).reshape(1, 2, 3)
        >>> numpoly.moveaxis(poly, 0, -1).shape
