    Return element-wise quotient and remainder simultaneously.

    ``numpoly.divmod(x, y)`` is equivalent to ``(x // y, x % y)``, but faster
    because it avoids redundant work. It is used to implement the Python
    built-in function ``divmod`` on arrays.

    Args:
        x1:
            Dividend array.
        x2:
            Divisor array. If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be
            broadcastable to a common shape (which becomes the shape of the
            output).
        out:
            A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must
            have a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or
            `None`, a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible
            only as a keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of
            outputs.
        where:
            This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
            condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
            Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value. Note
            that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
            ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
            remain uninitialized.
        kwargs:
            Keyword args passed to numpy.ufunc.

    Return:
        Element-wise quotient and remainder resulting from floor division.

    Raise:
        numpoly.baseclass.FeatureNotSupported:
            If either `x1` or `x2` contains indeterminants, numerical division
            is no longer possible and an error is raised instead. For
            polynomial division-remainder see ``numpoly.poly_divmod``.

    Example:
        >>> numpoly.divmod([1, 22, 444], 4)
        (polynomial([0, 5, 111]), polynomial([1, 2, 0]))
