    Return specified diagonals.

    If `a` is 2-D, returns the diagonal of `a` with the given offset,
    i.e., the collection of elements of the form ``a[i, i+offset]``.  If
    `a` has more than two dimensions, then the axes specified by `axis1`
    and `axis2` are used to determine the 2-D sub-array whose diagonal is
    returned.  The shape of the resulting array can be determined by
    removing `axis1` and `axis2` and appending an index to the right equal
    to the size of the resulting diagonals.

    Args:
        a:
            Array from which the diagonals are taken.
        offset:
            Offset of the diagonal from the main diagonal. Can be positive or
            negative. Defaults to main diagonal (0).
        axis1:
            Axis to be used as the first axis of the 2-D sub-arrays from which
            the diagonals should be taken.  Defaults to first axis (0).
        axis2:
            Axis to be used as the second axis of the 2-D sub-arrays from
            which the diagonals should be taken. Defaults to second axis (1).

    Return:
        If `a` is 2-D, then a 1-D array containing the diagonal and of the same
        type as `a` is returned unless `a` is a `matrix`, in which case a 1-D
        array rather than a (2-D) `matrix` is returned in order to maintain
        backward compatibility.

        If ``a.ndim > 2``, then the dimensions specified by `axis1` and `axis2`
        are removed, and a new axis inserted at the end corresponding to the
        diagonal.

    Raise:
        ValueError:
            If the dimension of `a` is less than 2.

    Example:
        >>> poly = numpoly.monomial(9).reshape(3, 3)
        >>> poly
        polynomial([[1, q0, q0**2],
                    [q0**3, q0**4, q0**5],
                    [q0**6, q0**7, q0**8]])
        >>> numpoly.diagonal(poly)
        polynomial([1, q0**4, q0**8])
