    Return the floor of the input, element-wise.

    The floor of the scalar `x` is the largest integer `i`, such that
    `i <= x`.  It is often denoted as :math:`\lfloor x \rfloor`.

    Args:
        x:
            Input data.
        out:
            A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must
            have a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or
            `None`, a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible
            only as a keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of
            outputs.
        where:
            This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
            condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
            Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value. Note
            that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
            ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
            remain uninitialized.
        kwargs:
            Keyword args passed to numpy.ufunc.

    Return:
        The floor of each element in `x`. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

    Example:
        >>> q0 = numpoly.variable()
        >>> numpoly.floor([-1.7*q0, q0-1.5, -0.2,
        ...                3.2+1.5*q0, 1.7, 2.0])
        polynomial([-2.0*q0, q0-2.0, -1.0, q0+3.0, 1.0, 2.0])
