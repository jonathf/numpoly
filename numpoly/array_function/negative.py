    Args:
        x:
            Input array.
        out:
            A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must
            have a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or
            `None`, a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible
            only as a keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of
            outputs.
        where : array_like, optional
            This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
            condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
            Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value. Note
            that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
            ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
            remain uninitialized.
        kwargs:
            Keyword args passed to numpy.ufunc.

    Return:
        Returned array or scalar: `y = -x`.
        This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

    Example:
        >>> q0 = numpoly.variable()
        >>> numpoly.negative([-q0, q0])
        polynomial([q0, -q0])
