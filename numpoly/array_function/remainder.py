    Return element-wise remainder of numerical division.

    Args:
        x1:
            Dividend array.
        x2:
            Divisor array. If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be
            broadcastable to a common shape (which becomes the shape of the
            output).
        out:
            A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must
            have a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or
            `None`, a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible
            only as a keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of
            outputs.
        where:
            This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
            condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
            Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value. Note
            that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
            ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
            remain uninitialized.
        kwargs:
            Keyword args passed to numpy.ufunc.

    Return:
        The element-wise remainder of the quotient ``floor_divide(x1, x2)``.
        This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

    Example:
        >>> numpoly.remainder([14, 7], 5)
        polynomial([4, 2])
        >>> numpoly.remainder(numpoly.variable(), 2)  # doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
