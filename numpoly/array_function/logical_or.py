    Compute the truth value of x1 OR x2 element-wise.

    Args:
        x1, x2:
            Logical OR is applied to the elements of `x1` and `x2`. If
            ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
            shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
        out:
            A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must
            have a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or
            `None`, a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible
            only as a keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of
            outputs.
        where:
            This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
            condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
            Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value. Note
            that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
            ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
            remain uninitialized.
        kwargs:
            Keyword args passed to numpy.ufunc.

    Return:
        Boolean result of the logical OR operation applied to the elements of
        `x1` and `x2`; the shape is determined by broadcasting.
        This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

    Example:
        >>> numpoly.logical_or(True, False)
        np.True_
        >>> numpoly.logical_or([True, False], [False, False])
        array([ True, False])
        >>> x = numpy.arange(5)
        >>> numpoly.logical_or(x < 1, x > 3)
        array([ True, False, False, False,  True])
